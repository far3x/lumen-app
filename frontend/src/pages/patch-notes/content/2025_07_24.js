    <h2>The Visibility Update: Major SEO & Social Sharing Enhancements</h2>
    <p>This update is dedicated to a critical aspect of Lumen's growth: its visibility. We have implemented a comprehensive SEO (Search Engine Optimization) and social media sharing strategy directly into our website's foundation. Our goal is to ensure that developers looking to monetize their work can find Lumen easily and that our mission is communicated clearly across the web.</p>
    
    <h3>What's New?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Comprehensive SEO Meta Tags:</strong> We've embedded a rich set of metadata into every page of our site. This includes a finely-tuned title, a compelling description, and a strategic list of keywords designed to help Lumen rank highly on search engines like Google for terms like "get paid for code," "monetize source code," and "developer rewards."
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Professional Social Sharing Embeds:</strong> When you share a link to <code>lumen.onl</code> on platforms like Discord, Twitter, or LinkedIn, it will now display a professional-looking preview card. This card includes a custom image, a clear title, and a concise description of the protocol, ensuring our brand is represented perfectly everywhere it's shared.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Structured Data for Rich Results:</strong> We have added Schema.org structured data (JSON-LD) to our site. This is an advanced SEO technique that helps search engines deeply understand what Lumen Protocol is. It can lead to enhanced "rich snippets" in search results, making our listings more attractive and informative to potential users.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
    <p>This is more than a technical update; it's a strategic move to grow our community. By making Lumen more discoverable, we are opening the door for thousands of new developers to find the platform, join the data economy, and start earning rewards for their hard work. It's a crucial step in building the supply side of our network and increasing the overall value of the protocol.</p>
