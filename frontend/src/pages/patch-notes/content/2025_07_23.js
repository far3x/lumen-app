    <h2>The Legal Framework & Docs Reorganization Update</h2>
    <p>This is a major update focused on establishing a professional legal framework for the protocol and significantly improving the structure and usability of our documentation. These changes are critical for building user trust and providing a clearer path for developers and partners to engage with Lumen.</p>
    
    <h3>New: Core Legal Documentation</h3>
    <p>To ensure clarity and provide robust legal protections for both our users and the protocol, we have introduced a comprehensive set of legal documents. You can now find a "Legal" section in our documentation and in the website footer.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Terms and Conditions:</strong> The primary agreement governing the use of the Lumen Protocol services.</li>
        <li><strong>Privacy Policy:</strong> A detailed explanation of what data we collect and how we process it, with a focus on GDPR and CCPA compliance.</li>
        <li><strong>Contributor License Agreement (CLA):</strong> The most critical document for our contributors. It makes it legally explicit that developers retain full ownership of their original code while granting Lumen the necessary license to use the anonymized data.</li>
        <li><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> A clear statement on the risks associated with cryptocurrency and the "as-is" nature of our services.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Improvement: Complete Documentation Reorganization</h3>
    <p>To make our documentation more intuitive and easier to navigate, we have restructured the entire section into logical categories:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Getting Started:</strong> For new users to understand the "what" and "why" of Lumen.</li>
        <li><strong>CLI Guide:</strong> A focused section for developers using our command-line tool.</li>
        <li><strong>Protocol:</strong> Deep dives into the core mechanics of how Lumen works.</li>
        <li><strong>Community & Ecosystem:</strong> Information on our roadmap and frequently asked questions.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal:</strong> The new home for all of our legal documents.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This new structure will make it much easier to find the information you need as our documentation grows.</p>

    <h3>Other Improvements & Fixes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Footer Update:</strong> The main website footer has been updated to include links to all four new legal pages under a dedicated "Legal" column.</li>
        <li><strong>Docs Redirect:</strong> Navigating to <code>lumen.onl/docs</code> will now automatically redirect users to the "Introduction" page, providing a better entry experience.</li>
    </ul>
