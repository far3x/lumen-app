        <h2>The Story of Lumen: A Complete Landing Page Redesign</h2>
        <p>We've completely redesigned our landing page from the ground up to better tell the story of Lumen. Our goal was to more clearly communicate our mission, showcase the power of the protocol, and provide a more intuitive and visually engaging experience for new developers and partners.</p>
        
        <h3>A New, Clearer Narrative</h3>
        <p>The page has been restructured to guide visitors through a compelling narrative:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>The Problem: "Your Code is Trapped."</strong> We now lead with the core problem that every developer faces: valuable proprietary code sitting idle and unrecognized in private repositories.</li>
            <li><strong>The Solution: "Lumen Sets It Free."</strong> We immediately follow up with our value proposition, explaining how Lumen provides the tools and network to securely unlock that value.</li>
            <li><strong>How It Works:</strong> The simple, three-step process for contributing is now presented more clearly, making it easier than ever to understand the path from code to rewards.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Show, Don't Just Tell: Visual Product Showcase</h3>
        <p>To provide tangible proof of our platform's capabilities, we've added two brand-new sections featuring high-resolution screenshots of the user dashboard:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Your Mission Control:</strong> This section showcases the main dashboard, giving a glimpse of the real-time earnings tracking, global rank, and contribution history.</li>
            <li><strong>Transparent Valuation:</strong> We now feature a look at the contribution detail modal, emphasizing our commitment to transparency by showing how every reward is calculated.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Highlighting Our Core Technology</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>State-of-the-Art Valuation:</strong> We've added a dedicated section to highlight our use of Google's advanced Gemini models, which form a key part of our fair and accurate valuation engine.</li>
            <li><strong>Technology Foundation:</strong> The technology logo carousel remains, showcasing the robust, world-class foundation upon which Lumen is built.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>A More Compelling Call to Action</h3>
        <p>The Genesis Contributor program, with its <strong>1,000 $LUM bonus</strong>, is now presented as a focused and exciting call to action near the end of the page, encouraging new developers to claim their spot and become foundational members of the network.</p>
