    <h2>The Genesis Update: A New Vision & A Wave of Enhancements</h2>
    <p>This is a pivotal moment for Lumen. Today's update is more than just a set of new features; it represents a major leap forward in our mission to build the definitive data layer for the AI revolution. We are thrilled to release our official Whitepaper and roll out a host of platform enhancements that refine our long-term vision.</p>
    
    <h3>Our Vision, Refined: The Official Lumen Whitepaper</h3>
    <p>We've always been more than just a protocol. Today, we're making it official. We have published the first version of the <strong>Lumen Protocol Whitepaper</strong>, which is now available in our documentation.</p>
    <p>This document is the blueprint for Lumen as a <strong>data company</strong>. It details our solution to the AI industry's data quality crisis, our robust local-first technology, and most importantly, our sustainable, revenue-driven business model (the "Economic Flywheel"). It clearly articulates how we turn capital into a defensible, proprietary data asset.</p>
    <blockquote>This is just the beginning. Our team is already working on an expanded, academic-grade version of the whitepaper, complete with deeper market research and technical specifications, which will be released soon.</blockquote>

    <h3>A Smarter, More Inclusive Experience</h3>
    <p>Based on early feedback, we have refined our messaging across the entire platform to be more inclusive and accurate. We believe in empowering every developer.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Principles, not Prescriptions:</strong> We've removed any language suggesting that certain programming languages or "private repos" are inherently more valuable. Our updated documentation and UI now focus on the true drivers of value: the <strong>novelty, quality, and complexity</strong> of your work. Any developer, working on any project, can contribute a high-value asset to the network.</li>
        <li><strong>Redesigned "My Contributions" Page:</strong> The "Pro Tips" section has been completely redesigned into a sleek, professional "Principles of Value" component. It's cleaner, more inspiring, and better aligned with our core mission.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Complete Documentation Overhaul</h3>
    <p>To support our new vision, we have restructured and polished our entire documentation section for a best-in-class experience.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>New Structure:</strong> The docs are now organized into logical categories like "Getting Started," "CLI Guide," and "Protocol," making information easier to find.</li>
        <li><strong>Seamless Navigation:</strong> We've added GitBook-style "Previous/Next" buttons at the bottom of every page for a more fluid reading experience. The button UI has also been streamlined to be cleaner and single-line.</li>
        <li><strong>Full Legal Framework:</strong> We have added a complete legal section, including our Terms and Conditions, Privacy Policy, and a critical <strong>Contributor License Agreement (CLA)</strong> that formally protects your ownership of your original code.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Bug Squashing & UI Polish</h3>
    <p>We've also pushed a number of fixes to improve the stability and user experience of the platform:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Fixed CLI Redirect Bug:</strong> Resolved an issue where an expired CLI authorization link could cause an incorrect redirect after logging in. The system now includes a 1-hour expiration and a manual close button on the page.</li>
        <li><strong>Resolved "Stuck Claiming" Button:</strong> Fixed a bug where the "Claiming..." button could remain in a loading state after the transaction was complete. The button now correctly resets upon success or failure.</li>
        <li><strong>Footer Layout Corrected:</strong> Fixed a visual bug in the footer layout that appeared on wider screens, ensuring a clean and balanced look on all devices.</li>
        <li><strong>Smarter Footer CTA:</strong> The call-to-action in the footer is now context-aware. It will no longer prompt you to "Go to Dashboard" if you are already on the dashboard, or "Get Started" if you are already on the login/signup page.</li>
        <li><strong>Community Link Update:</strong> All social links have been updated to point to our new official X (formerly Twitter) account: <strong><a href="https://x.com/lumencli" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-external="true">@lumencli</a></strong>.</li>
    </ul>
