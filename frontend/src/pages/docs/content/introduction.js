    <p class="lead text-xl text-text-secondary">Lumen is a decentralized data sourcing protocol, built on the Solana blockchain, designed to acquire and remunerate high-quality, structured data for the training of next-generation AI models.</p>
    
    <h2 id="the-data-imperative">The Data Imperative in Modern AI</h2>
    <p>The race for Artificial Intelligence dominance is no longer bottlenecked by algorithms, but by the availability of high-quality, proprietary data. The public internet has been exhausted, and its quality is rapidly degrading. The future of AI requires a new data source—one that is ethically sourced, structurally sound, and rich with logical intent.</p>
    <p>The largest repository of this data is the vast collection of source code locked away in private repositories worldwide. This is the data that can teach AI models true reasoning, and it remains almost entirely untapped.</p>
    <blockquote>Lumen was built to solve this. We are creating a robust, decentralized pipeline for sourcing this critical data, beginning with the code that powers our digital world.</blockquote>
    
    <h2 id="the-lumen-solution">The Lumen Solution: A Strategic Data Layer</h2>
    <p>Lumen introduces a symbiotic, two-sided marketplace designed to scale on the Solana network:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Data Contributors:</strong> Developers globally use the secure Lumen CLI to contribute anonymized source code. For their contributions, they are rewarded with <strong>$LUM</strong>, the protocol's native data-sourcing token. This provides a direct economic incentive for sharing valuable data.</li>
        <li><strong>AI Consumers:</strong> AI companies and researchers access Lumen's curated datasets to train their advanced models. This creates a direct, sustainable demand for the data sourced by Lumen, establishing a powerful, self-sustaining economic loop.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By launching on Solana, we leverage a high-throughput, low-cost environment ideal for the large volume of micro-transactions required for data remuneration. This strategic alignment places Lumen at the heart of the AI revolution.</p>
