    <h1 id="tokenomics">$LUM: The Data Sourcing Token</h1>
    <p class="lead text-xl text-text-secondary">The $LUM token is the native currency of the Lumen Protocol, operating on the Avalanche C-Chain. It is specifically designed to incentivize the contribution of high-value data, forming a critical part of the broader Skillful AI economic model.</p>

    <h2 id="a-dual-token-economy">A Dual-Token Economy: $LUM & $SKAI</h2>
    <p>The ecosystem is powered by two distinct but synergistic tokens:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>$LUM</code> <strong>(Lumen Protocol):</strong> The primary incentive token. Its purpose is to reward developers for contributing the raw material—high-quality data—that the entire ecosystem is built upon. It is the currency of data sourcing.</li>
        <li><code>$SKAI</code> <strong>(Skillful AI):</strong> The primary utility token of the Skillful AI platform. It is used to access creator tools, subscribe to services, and transact on the AI marketplace. It is the currency of AI consumption and creation.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This dual-token system creates a clear and efficient economic flow. Lumen focuses exclusively on optimizing data acquisition, while Skillful AI focuses on building a vibrant marketplace for AI services. Value generated in the Skillful AI marketplace drives the demand for better data, which in turn drives the value and utility of the $LUM rewards.</p>
    
    <h2 id="lum-core-utility">Core Utility of $LUM</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Data Contribution Rewards:</strong> The sole function of $LUM is to be the reward mechanism for developers who contribute their anonymized code via the Lumen CLI.</li>
        <li><strong>Governance:</strong> Holding $LUM will grant voting rights over the Lumen Protocol itself, allowing the community to guide the future of the data valuation engine, reward structures, and supported data types.</li>
        <li><strong>Protocol Buybacks (Future):</strong> As the Lumen Protocol generates revenue by providing data to the Skillful AI ecosystem, a portion of these earnings will be used to buy back $LUM from the open market to replenish the reward pools, creating a sustainable, deflationary pressure.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2 id="deployment-on-avalanche">Deployment on Avalanche</h2>
    <p>$LUM will be launched as an ERC-20 token on the Avalanche (AVAX) C-Chain. This strategic choice was made for several key reasons:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Low Transaction Fees:</strong> Essential for making reward claims economically viable for all contributors, regardless of the size of their reward.</li>
        <li><strong>High Throughput:</strong> The ability to process a large volume of transactions quickly is critical for a protocol designed to handle millions of data contributions.</li>
        <li><strong>Thriving Ecosystem:</strong> Avalanche is rapidly becoming a hub for DePIN, AI, and gaming projects, placing Lumen and Skillful AI at the center of a vibrant and innovative community.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="supply-and-emission">Total Supply & Emission Schedule</h2>
    <p>The total supply of $LUM is fixed at <strong>1,000,000,000</strong> tokens. The emission schedule is designed to aggressively reward early adopters.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The Genesis Program:</strong> The first <strong>500 unique developers</strong> to make a valuable contribution will receive a one-time <strong>bonus of 500 $LUM</strong>, on top of their standard reward. This program is designed to bootstrap the initial, critical mass of data for the Skillful AI ecosystem.</li>
        <li><strong>Epoch-Based Halving:</strong> The base reward rate for contributions is governed by epochs tied to the total data contributed to the network. This means contributions made today will earn significantly more $LUM than those made in the future, creating a powerful incentive to join the network early.</li>
    </ul>
