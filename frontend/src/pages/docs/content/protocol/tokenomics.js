    <h1 id="protocol-economy">The Protocol Economy</h1>
    <p class="lead text-xl text-text-secondary">Lumen's tokenomy is the engine of our ecosystem. It is designed for long-term sustainability and is fueled by real-world utility. The system ensures that every participant, from individual developers to enterprise data consumers, is incentivized to contribute to the network's growth.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <strong>Note on Rewards:</strong> To provide stability and immediate real-world value to our contributors, all rewards on the Lumen Protocol are calculated in USD and paid out in <strong>USDC</strong>, a stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the US Dollar. The $LUMEN token is reserved for protocol utility and governance.
    </blockquote>

    <h2 id="genesis-phase">Phase 1: The Autonomous Flywheel (Current State)</h2>
    <p>We are currently in the Autonomous Flywheel phase. The protocol is designed to be self-sustaining, leveraging its own economic activity to fund contributor rewards and operational costs without relying on continuous external funding. This is achieved through the intelligent allocation of trading fees generated on our partner launchpad, Heaven.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Trading Fee Allocation:</strong> 100% of the trading fees generated by the $LUMEN token are automatically routed to the protocol's multi-sig treasury and allocated as follows:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>40% to the Reward Pool:</strong> This capital is converted to USDC and directly funds the weekly payouts to developers for their contributions.</li>
                <li><strong>30% to the Operations Fund:</strong> Covers essential infrastructure costs such as servers, AI model API usage, and other business-critical subscriptions.</li>
                <li><strong>30% to the Growth Fund:</strong> Used for strategic buybacks of the $LUMEN token to create positive price pressure and support long-term market health.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Proportional Payouts & Accrued Rewards:</strong> Each week, the total USD value of rewards owed to all contributors is calculated. The available USDC in the Reward Pool is then distributed proportionally. For example, if $10,000 in rewards are owed and the pool contains $4,000, every contributor receives 40% of their pending balance. The remaining 60% is tracked as "Accrued Rewards," a balance the protocol is committed to paying out as revenue grows.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="sustainable-economy">Phase 2: The Enterprise-Fueled Economy</h2>
    <p>The current Autonomous Flywheel is the bridge to our long-term, enterprise-driven economic model. Once the protocol's dataset reaches a critical mass of quality and scale, revenue from data sales will supercharge the system.</p>
    <div class="my-8 p-6 bg-surface border border-primary rounded-lg">
        <h3 id="flywheel-effect" class="font-bold text-lg text-text-main mb-2">The First Data Sale Milestone: Clearing the Slate</h3>
        <p>A significant portion (e.g., 50%+) of the revenue from the <strong>first major enterprise data sale</strong> will be dedicated to a one-time event: instantly clearing the entire outstanding balance of Accrued Rewards for all Genesis-phase contributors. This milestone validates the entire model and delivers the full, promised value to our earliest supporters.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h3>The Enterprise Revenue Split</h3>
    <p>Once enterprise revenue becomes consistent, it will be allocated according to a transparent, growth-oriented model designed to benefit all protocol participants:</p>
     <ul>
        <li><strong>60% to Protocol Growth & Treasury:</strong> The majority of revenue is reinvested into the protocol. This builds a robust treasury to pre-fund future reward batches (ensuring stability), expand the core team, and fund marketing and ecosystem grants.</li>
        <li><strong>20% to Rewarding Contributors:</strong> This portion directly supplements the Reward Pool, increasing the size and frequency of USDC payouts to developers and accelerating the settlement of any Accrued Rewards.</li>
        <li><strong>20% to Deflationary Buybacks:</strong> This creates a powerful, direct link between revenue and token value. 20% of every dollar earned from data sales is used to buy back $LUMEN from the open market and permanently burn it, reducing the total supply.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="lum-utility">The Role of the $LUMEN Token: Capturing Protocol Value</h2>
    <p>The value of the $LUMEN token is not based on future promises, but on concrete mechanisms that capture the value generated by the protocol today and amplify it tomorrow. The primary utilities are deflationary pressure and governance control.</p>
    
    <h3>Buybacks & Burns: Linking Activity to Scarcity</h3>
    <p>The core value accrual mechanism for $LUMEN is its deflationary design. The token supply is programmed to shrink as the protocol succeeds through two powerful, continuous buyback sources:</p>
     <ul>
        <li><strong>From Trading Fees:</strong> 30% of all trading fees are used for buybacks, creating a constant baseline of deflationary pressure driven by market activity.</li>
        <li><strong>From Enterprise Revenue:</strong> 20% of all data sales revenue is used for buybacks, creating a powerful scaling mechanism where protocol success directly translates into increased token scarcity.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Governance: Shaping the Future</h3>
    <p>$LUMEN holders will have the power to vote on Lumen Improvement Proposals (LIPs), giving them direct control over the protocol's future. This includes key decisions on the valuation engine, fee mechanics, and treasury management. As the protocol matures, token holders will be able to vote on introducing new utility mechanisms, such as staking, ensuring Lumen evolves into a true piece of community-owned infrastructure.</p>
