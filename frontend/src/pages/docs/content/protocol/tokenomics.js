    <h1 id="protocol-economy">The Protocol Economy</h1>
    <p class="lead text-xl text-text-secondary">The Lumen Protocol is powered by a sustainable economic model designed to fairly reward developers for the value they create. The system is fueled by real-world revenue and pays out in a stable, trusted digital asset (USDC).</p>

    <h2 id="rewards-mechanism">The Rewards Mechanism for Developers</h2>
    <p>Your reward is calculated in USD from the moment your contribution is valued. This provides a clear and stable understanding of the value you've created, insulated from market volatility. These accrued USD balances are then paid out automatically in daily batches.</p>
    <blockquote>We utilize the Solana blockchain for its high speed and near-zero transaction fees. Payouts are made in USDC, a stablecoin pegged 1:1 with the US Dollar. This ensures that when you receive your rewards, you keep what you have earned without losing value to network costs or price fluctuations.</blockquote>

        <h3 id="flywheel-effect" class="font-bold text-lg text-text-main mb-2">The Economic Engine: A Direct Value Loop</h3>
        <p class="text-text-secondary">Our business model is straightforward and sustainable. It directly connects the value of the data to the rewards paid to the developers who create it.</p>
        <ol class="!my-4 list-decimal list-inside space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Enterprise Revenue:</strong> AI companies and data consumers purchase access to Lumen's premium, proprietary datasets using traditional currency (e.g., USD or USDC). This real-world revenue is the engine of the entire system.</li>
            <li><strong>Funding the Treasury:</strong> This revenue directly funds the protocol's treasury wallet.</li>
            <li><strong>Daily Developer Payouts:</strong> Every 24 hours, the protocol automatically distributes the accrued rewards from the treasury to contributors in the form of USDC.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This model creates a direct, transparent link between the commercial success of the data marketplace and the rewards paid to our community. The value is driven by utility, not speculation.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="economic-loop">The Role of the $LUMEN Token</h2>
    <p>While daily rewards are paid in USDC for stability, the native protocol token, $LUMEN, will serve critical functions within the ecosystem, primarily focused on governance and utility.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Governance:</strong> $LUMEN holders will have the power to vote on Lumen Improvement Proposals (LIPs), shaping the future of the protocol's features, fee structures, and treasury management.</li>
        <li><strong>Staking & Data Access:</strong> In future phases, staking $LUMEN may be required for certain tiers of data access or to receive a share of protocol fees, aligning long-term holders with the success of the network.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This dual-asset model provides the best of both worlds: the stability of USDC for immediate, tangible rewards, and the utility of $LUMEN for long-term governance and participation in the protocol's success.</p>
