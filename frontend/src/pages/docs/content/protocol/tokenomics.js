    <h1 id="the-lum-token">The $LUM Reward Token: Fueling the Ecosystem</h1>
    <p class="lead text-xl text-text-secondary">The Lumen Protocol uses a native utility token, $LUM, as its internal unit of value. Think of it as <strong>Protocol Credits</strong> that represent a direct stake in the data economy you are helping to build.</p>

    <h2 id="utility-for-developers">Utility for Developers</h2>
    <p>$LUM is the medium through which the value of your contribution is captured and transferred to you. You can track your earnings in real-time on your dashboard. Upon the token's public launch, you will be able to claim your rewards on-chain to a self-custody wallet.</p>
    <blockquote>We utilize the Solana blockchain for its high speed and near-zero transaction fees, ensuring that when you claim your rewards, you keep what you have earned without losing significant value to network costs.</blockquote>
    
    <h2 id="the-economic-loop">The Economic Loop: A Sustainable Model</h2>
    <p>Our tokenomics are designed for long-term sustainability, creating a powerful economic loop that benefits contributors directly, without requiring them to speculate on crypto markets.</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Revenue Generation:</strong> AI companies and data consumers purchase access to Lumen's proprietary datasets using traditional currency (e.g., USD).</li>
        <li><strong>Market Buy-Back:</strong> Lumen Protocol uses a significant portion of this real-world revenue to buy $LUM tokens from the open market (e.g., from a decentralized exchange).</li>
        <li><strong>Reward Pool Funding:</strong> These purchased tokens are then deposited into the protocol's dedicated reward pool.</li>
        <li><strong>Contributor Rewards:</strong> The reward pool is used to distribute $LUM to developers for their valuable code contributions.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This model creates constant, sustainable buy pressure on the token that is directly linked to the commercial success and demand for the data on the network. The more valuable our data becomes to AI companies, the more valuable the rewards become for our community of contributors. The value is driven by utility, not speculation.</p>
