    <h1 id="protocol-economy">The Protocol Economy</h1>
    <p class="lead text-xl text-text-secondary">Lumen's tokenomy is the engine of our ecosystem. It is designed for long term sustainability and is fueled by real world utility. The system ensures that every participant, from individual developers to enterprise data consumers, is incentivized to contribute to the network's growth.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <strong>Note on Rewards:</strong> To provide stability and immediate real-world value to our contributors, all rewards on the Lumen Protocol are calculated in USD and paid out in <strong>USDC</strong>, a stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the US Dollar. The $LUMEN token is reserved for protocol utility and governance.
    </blockquote>

    <h2 id="genesis-phase">Phase 1: The Genesis Phase (Current State)</h2>
    <p>We are currently in the Genesis Phase, a critical period of strategic data acquisition. Unlike protocols that rely on future promises, we are actively deploying our own capital to reward contributors with real world value today. Our private investors are funding a robust rewards pool to build the foundational dataset that will power the entire network.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Immediate USDC Rewards:</strong> Your contributions are appraised by our valuation engine and assigned a direct USD value. This value accrues in your account and is paid out automatically in USDC. The value you earn is the value you receive.</li>
        <li><strong>Permanent Reward Multiplier:</strong> As a reward for your early belief in our vision, all Genesis Contributors receive a permanent boost to their account's reward multiplier. This means you will continue to earn more for your contributions, forever.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="sustainable-economy">Phase 2: The Sustainable Economy</h2>
    <p>The current investment in data acquisition is the bridge to our long term, self sustaining economic model. Once the protocol's dataset reaches critical mass and enterprise sales begin, this powerful economic flywheel will be activated.</p>

        <h3 id="flywheel-effect" class="font-bold text-lg text-text-main mb-2">The Enterprise Flywheel: Linking Revenue to Rewards</h3>
        <ol class="!my-4 list-decimal list-inside space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Enterprise Revenue:</strong> AI companies purchase access to Lumen's premium, proprietary datasets, generating real world revenue in USDC.</li>
            <li><strong>Funding the Treasury:</strong> This revenue directly funds the protocol's treasury, creating a sustainable source for rewards.</li>
            <li><strong>Developer Payouts:</strong> The protocol continues its daily, automated USDC payouts to contributors, now funded by enterprise revenue instead of initial investor capital.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This model creates a direct, transparent, and sustainable link between the commercial success of the data marketplace and the rewards paid to our community of developers.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="lum-utility">The Role of the LUMEN Token: Utility & Governance</h2>
    <p>While daily rewards are paid in USDC for stability, the native protocol token, LUMEN, serves critical functions within the ecosystem. The demand for LUMEN is driven entirely by its utility, making it essential for unlocking the protocol's most valuable features.</p>
    
    <h3>Staking: The Key to Enhanced Value</h3>
    <p>Staking LUMEN is the mechanism for participants to signal their long term commitment and unlock enhanced privileges.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>For Data Consumers: The Lumen Index.</strong> The highest tier of contributions, as ranked by our valuation engine, is reserved for an exclusive pool called the Lumen Index. To gain API access to this premium data, companies must purchase and stake LUMEN tokens. This creates powerful, non speculative demand from our most capitalized users.</li>
        <li><strong>For Developers: Multiplier Staking.</strong> Contributors can stake LUMEN to increase their personal Reward Multiplier. This creates a powerful feedback loop: contribute, earn USDC, use it to acquire and stake LUMEN, and earn even more on future contributions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Buybacks & Burns: Linking Revenue to Scarcity</h3>
    <p>A portion of all USDC revenue generated from enterprise data sales will be used to perform an automated, on market buy back of LUMEN tokens. These purchased tokens will then be transparently burned, permanently reducing the total supply. As protocol revenue grows, the token supply systematically shrinks, directly linking our commercial success to token scarcity.</p>

    <h3>Governance: Shaping the Future</h3>
    <p>LUMEN holders will have the power to vote on Lumen Improvement Proposals (LIPs), giving them direct control over the protocol's future. This includes key decisions on the valuation engine, fee mechanics, and treasury management, ensuring Lumen evolves into a true piece of community owned infrastructure.</p>
