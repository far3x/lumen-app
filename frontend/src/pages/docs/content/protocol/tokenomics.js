    <h1 id="protocol-economy">The Protocol Economy</h1>
    <p class="lead text-xl text-text-secondary">The Lumen Protocol is powered by a sustainable economic model designed to fairly reward developers for the value they create. The native protocol reward, LUMEN, functions as the internal unit of value and the mechanism for this exchange.</p>

    <h2 id="rewards-mechanism">The Rewards Mechanism for Developers</h2>
    <p>LUMEN is the medium through which the value of a code contribution is captured and transferred to the developer. When you contribute, our valuation engine appraises your work and allocates a corresponding amount of LUMEN to your account. This system ensures that your compensation is directly tied to the quality and novelty of your contribution.</p>
    <blockquote>We utilize the Solana blockchain for its high speed and near zero transaction fees. This ensures that when you claim your rewards to your personal wallet, you keep what you have earned without losing significant value to network costs.</blockquote>

        <h3 id="flywheel-effect" class="font-bold text-lg text-text-main mb-2">The Flywheel Effect: How Your Contribution Creates Value</h3>
        <p class="text-text-secondary">Every line of high-quality code you contribute makes the Lumen dataset more powerful and valuable to AI companies. As the dataset grows, it attracts more enterprise clients, generating more revenue. A significant portion of this revenue is then used to <strong>buy back $LUMEN tokens from the open market</strong> to replenish the reward pool. This creates a direct, sustainable link: more contributions lead to a better product, which leads to more revenue and more buying pressure on the token. Your work doesn't just earn you rewards; it strengthens the entire ecosystem.</p>

    <h2 id="economic-loop">The Economic Loop: A Sustainable Business Model</h2>
    <p>Our economy is designed for long term sustainability, creating a powerful "flywheel" that benefits contributors directly, driven by real world business revenue.</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Enterprise Revenue:</strong> AI companies and data consumers purchase access to Lumen's premium, proprietary datasets using traditional currency (e.g., USD). This real world revenue is the engine of the entire system.</li>
        <li><strong>Funding the Reward Pool:</strong> A significant portion of that revenue is used to acquire LUMEN from the open market or directly fund the protocol's dedicated reward pool.</li>
        <li><strong>Contributor Rewards:</strong> This pool is then used to distribute LUMEN to developers for their valuable code contributions, incentivizing the creation of more high quality data.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This model creates constant, sustainable demand for the protocol's rewards that is directly linked to the commercial success of the data marketplace. The value is driven by utility, not speculation.</p>
