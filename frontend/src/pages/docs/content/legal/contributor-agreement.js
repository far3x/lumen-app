This Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement") is a legally binding document.</p>
    <p>You and we acknowledge that this Agreement is in addition to our main <a href="/docs/terms" class="text-red-600 hover:underline">Terms and Conditions</a>. In case of any conflict between the Terms and Conditions and this Agreement regarding Contributions, the terms of this Agreement shall prevail.</p>

    <h2 id="your-representations-and-warranties">4. Your Representations and Warranties</h2>
