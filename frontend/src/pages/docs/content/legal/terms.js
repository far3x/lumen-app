    <p>While rewards are paid in USDC, the protocol has a native utility token, $LUMEN. You understand that the value of any cryptocurrency, including $LUMEN, is highly volatile. All transactions on the Solana blockchain are final and irreversible. You are solely responsible for the security of your personal cryptocurrency wallet and its private keys.</p>
    <h3>Data Contribution License</h3>
    <p>By submitting any source code or related materials ("Data") to the protocol, you confirm that you have the full right and authority to do so. You retain complete ownership of your original Data. You grant the Lumen Protocol a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license to use, reproduce, modify, and distribute the anonymized version of your contributed Data for the purpose of creating datasets for training artificial intelligence models and for sublicensing this anonymized data to third parties.</p>
