    <h1 id="the-lumen-advantage">The Lumen Advantage</h1>
    <p class="lead text-xl text-text-secondary">Lumen provides a unique and compelling value proposition for every participant in the new AI data economy. We are not just a platform; we are critical infrastructure.</p>

    <h2 id="for-developers">For Developers: Monetize Your Work, Securely</h2>
    <p>Your work has powered the digital world. Now, it will power the intelligent one. Lumen ensures you are a key stakeholder in this revolution.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Meaningful Rewards:</strong> Contribute your anonymized code and earn Protocol Credits ($LUM). Your work directly fuels the AI ecosystem, and you are rewarded for the value you provide based on a sophisticated, transparent <a href="/docs/valuation">valuation engine</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Effortless & Secure:</strong> Our "local-first" CLI ensures your code is anonymized on your machine before upload. Your security and intellectual property are protected by design. <a href="/docs/security">Learn more about our security-first approach</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Direct Impact:</strong> The data you contribute will be used to train the next generation of AI models and developer tools that you yourself will use, helping to solve real-world problems and advance the state of the art.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="for-data-consumers">For Data Consumers & Investors: The Proprietary Data Advantage</h2>
    <p>Lumen is the definitive data pipeline for AI companies and researchers, providing a strategic advantage in the race for superior model performance.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>A Truly Proprietary Data Source:</strong> Lumen provides access to a growing dataset of high-quality source code—data that is not available on the public internet. This is the key to training models that can outperform those trained on generic, scraped data.</li>
        <li><strong>Human-Generated Ground Truth:</strong> Our dataset breaks the cycle of "AI eating itself." Every line of code is verified human-written, providing the high-signal ground truth needed to teach models genuine reasoning instead of memorization.</li>
        <li><strong>Precision Filtering:</strong> Our data is not a monolith. Data consumers will have API access to filter datasets by language, our proprietary quality score, and AI-generated summaries, allowing for the creation of perfectly tailored, high-value training sets.</li>
        <li><strong>Ethical & Legally Sound:</strong> All data is ethically sourced with explicit consent from contributors via our Contributor License Agreement, mitigating the significant copyright and privacy risks associated with web scraping.</li>
    </ul>
