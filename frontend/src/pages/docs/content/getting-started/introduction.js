    <h1 id="introduction">Introduction: The Data Layer for Intelligent AI</h1>
    <p class="lead text-xl text-text-secondary">The advancement of Artificial Intelligence is fundamentally bottlenecked by the diminishing quality and ethical concerns of publicly scraped data. The most valuable dataset on the planet, proprietary; human-written source code, remains locked away in private repositories, its potential untapped. Lumen Protocol is a decentralized data sourcing network designed to solve this.</p>
    <blockquote>We provide developers with a secure, local-first CLI tool to contribute anonymized code and earn tangible rewards for their work. This ethically sourced, high-signal data is then made available to AI companies to train next-generation models capable of true logical reasoning.</blockquote>

    <h2 id="the-genesis">The Genesis: From Idea to Inception</h2>
    <p>Every revolutionary project starts with a simple observation. Ours was this: the AI industry was building skyscrapers on foundations of sand, training powerful models on the noisy, unreliable, and legally dubious data scraped from the public internet. We saw a future where AI would hit a quality ceiling, unable to improve because it lacked access to the structured, logical, and novel data it needed most.</p>
    <p>The solution was clear: create a system to unlock the world's most valuable private data, source code, and create a fair economic model to reward its creators. This led to the creation of the Lumen Protocol.</p>
    
    <h3>Our Foundational Milestones:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>A Secure, Local-First CLI:</strong> We engineered the <code>pylumen</code> CLI, an open-source tool that performs all sensitive operations, analysis; secret scrubbing; and anonymization, on the developer's machine. Your raw code never leaves your computer.</li>
        <li><strong>A Hybrid Valuation Engine:</strong> We developed a sophisticated engine that combines quantitative code metrics with qualitative analysis from advanced AI models (like Google's Gemini family) to ensure every contribution is valued fairly and transparently.</li>
        <li><strong>Scalable Infrastructure:</strong> We built our backend on a high-performance stack, including <code>pgvector</code> for near-instantaneous uniqueness checks, ensuring the contributor experience remains fast and fluid, even as the network scales to millions of contributions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="phase-one">Phase 1: The Foundation (Where We Are Now)</h2>
    <p>Our current objective is to bootstrap the world's most valuable proprietary code dataset and build a trusted community of foundational contributors. We are focused on the following strategic objectives:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Onboard 500 Genesis Contributors:</strong> Through our limited Beta Program, we are building our foundational community and rewarding our earliest adopters with a bonus for their contributions.</li>
        <li><strong>Secure Pre-Seed Investment:</strong> We are actively seeking strategic partners and investors to help us accelerate our roadmap and scale our operations.</li>
        <li><strong>Establish Legal Framework:</strong> We have established a full suite of legal documents, including a clear Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, and a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) that legally protects developer IP.</li>
        <li><strong>Commit to Open Source:</strong> The <code>pylumen</code> CLI is already open-source. We are committed to progressively open-sourcing other core components of the protocol to foster community trust and collaboration.</li>
    </ul>
