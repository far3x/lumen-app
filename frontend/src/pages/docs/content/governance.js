    <h1 id="governance">Protocol Governance</h1>
    <p class="lead text-xl text-text-secondary">Lumen is not a company; it's a piece of public infrastructure. Our ultimate goal is for the protocol to be fully owned and operated by its community of $LUM token holders.</p>

    <h2 id="lumen-improvement-proposals">Lumen Improvement Proposals (LIPs)</h2>
    <p>The formal mechanism for shaping the future of the protocol is the Lumen Improvement Proposal (LIP). A LIP is a design document providing information to the Lumen community, or describing a new feature for the protocol or its processes or environment.</p>
    <p>The LIP process is designed to be transparent and collaborative:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Community Discussion:</strong> A new idea is first proposed informally on the Lumen Governance Forum (launching in Phase 2). This allows for initial feedback, debate, and refinement from the entire community.</li>
        <li><strong>Formal Proposal (LIP Draft):</strong> If the idea gains traction, a community member or team drafts a formal LIP following a standardized template. This document details the proposal's motivation, technical specifications, and potential impact.</li>
        <li><strong>On-Chain Voting:</strong> Once finalized, the LIP is submitted for an on-chain vote. The voting power of each participant is proportional to the amount of $LUM they hold or have staked. A pre-defined quorum and majority threshold must be met for the proposal to pass.</li>
        <li><strong>Implementation:</strong> If a LIP is approved by the token holders, it is officially adopted. The implementation can be carried out by the core development team or funded by a community grant from the Treasury to a qualified third-party team.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="areas-of-governance">Areas of Governance</h2>
    <p>Token holders will have control over the most critical aspects of the protocol, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Protocol Upgrades:</strong> Approving significant changes to the valuation engine, anonymization process, or core smart contracts.</li>
        <li><strong>Fee Mechanics:</strong> Adjusting the percentage of fees taken on data sales that go to the Treasury, stakers, or are burned.</li>
        <li><strong>Treasury Allocation:</strong> Voting on how to spend funds from the community-controlled Treasury, such as funding developer grants, marketing campaigns, or strategic partnerships.</li>
        <li><strong>Reward Parameters:</strong> Making adjustments to the Epoch halving schedule or other contributor reward mechanisms.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="progressive-decentralization">The Path to Progressive Decentralization</h2>
    <p>True decentralization cannot be achieved overnight. It is a deliberate, phased process. In the early stages, the core Lumen team will act as stewards of the protocol, guiding development and ensuring stability. However, with each phase of the roadmap, more power and responsibility will be transferred to the community.</p>
    <blockquote>Our success will be measured not by our control over the protocol, but by our ability to make ourselves obsolete, leaving behind a thriving, self-sustaining, community-owned data economy.</blockquote>
