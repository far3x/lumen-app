#dont take into account these commands, its just to make life easier in the terminal

restart doppler after update :
git pull
doppler run -- docker compose build
doppler run -- docker compose up

if crash after rollout update:
git checkout commit_hash
doppler run -- docker compose up --build

clear space safely (remove unused then cache i think):
docker system prune
docker system prune -a

to connect to db locally, never run this on vps
ssh -L 63333:localhost:5432 root@69.62.107.41 -N
then dbeaver login

to access the db locally:
podman compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec db psql -U lumen_user -d lumen_exchange


GEMINI PLEASE READ THIS - AI INSTRUCTIONS HERE - PLEASE READ !!

little info if you are reading this as an ai model, the prod environment runs using doppler
dev runs using .env's (prod.env is there in case i lose access on the doppler, just as a local backup, dont take it into account)
bonus info, there is redis volume for the prod so restarts wont impact rate limits, not a thing in dev because need to test with 0 rate limits
also, output any code change entirely with 0 comments
if you do any code change, output the files that change in their entirity, and explain anything outside the code boxes, if any setup is needed for new variables or whatever
good luck !
