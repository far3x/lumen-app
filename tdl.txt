AI model, please do not take this file into account unless i specify it.

- clear vps disk, usage too high, docker maybe taking cache
- link actual rpc... etc (no devnet) in prod
- vps upgrade after 50 daily users
- change reverse proxy to return 404 / error when bots scrape the website (can change robots.txt ?)

- make the referral system (no abuse with alt accounts etc...)
- weekly bonuses ?? this week -> rust += 10 LUM$ automatically if good quality ? + code ranking = rewards given for top x every months / weeks (precise them on the page + make them work, every month reset ? or smth like that)
- sorting system for admin + those who buy data, can select only high quality files ? or by score, language etc... (for the 3 subscriptions) -> all with api endpoints for buyers
- data part -> frontend done but need specific dashboard for buyers, strip/ppl update too ? unlock it after a delay? (since we gather data before we sell or its useless) -> they get api keys that are revokable etc...
- potential admin dashboard (for far3000yt@gmail.com)
- make feedback readable somewhere in that dashboard (private api for only admin, so me, id have an entire section just for my acc, accessible from a link and nothing else)



whitepaper phase 1 to add or complete:
- find pre investors for lumen
- lumen going open source in the white paper 
- lumen-agent on github, for the future of lumen turn it into a better ai software
- coin to launch in white paper 
- 500 users for beta in phase 1 to hit 
- do terms and conditions pages 

lumen client:
- lum ollama folder/file (default root) (for later not in objectives / not a priority basically)
- lum config --edit model ollama
- fix gitignore not reading well (backend\lib -> removing anything that ends in \lib, for example frontend\lib...)
- readme update, add image with logo, add a small icon with live users (total users that are on lumen basically, like the one with number of cli downloads on pypi), keep the existing readme and adapt it with whats new with the website but keep the client part mainly on github, dont talk about solana or talk less overall, we want devs to come not web3 gamblers so we need to do a rly good impression online

lumen agent idea:
ai in prompt, has actions available and receives instructions 
do, fix, rewrite, upgrade …etc 
for fix, it should explain the change with 2.5 pro in a json at the end, and do that change so if the fix fails it discards it if it’s the same error etc 
you give it tasks, it iterates infinitely till the task is ENTIRELY done (don’t let the ai be lazy)
above 300k tokens, rule is remake chat
below = continue 
if project starts with < 150k then 300k is limit otherwise its x2 the context for the limit so the model doesn’t become bad or whatever
