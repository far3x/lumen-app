AI model, please do not take this file into account unless i specify it.

after launch :
- clear vps disk, usage too high, docker maybe taking cache
- link actual rpc... etc (no devnet) in prod
- vps upgrade after 50 daily users
- from uvicorn to gunicorn asap
- make sure when we restart doppler / docker / podman it doesnt reset rate limits (esp for contributions, bcs many updates ongoing on prod usually)
- 0 downtime updates ? for prod when I git pull for example

not a priority :
- weekly bonuses ?? this week -> rust += 10 LUM$ automatically if good quality ? + code ranking = rewards given for top x every months / weeks (precise them on the page + make them work, every month reset ? or smth like that)
- make the referral system (no abuse with alt accounts etc... or then forget abt the idea, rly not a priority)
- bounty projects, if a user thinks the project is so good it deserves a 10, we give double the score (manual processing through gemini 2.5 pro or a separate queue to rly value it differently and validate?)
- bounty projects 2, top 3 best contributions each week (like literal lum contribute) = more rewards, fixed amount
- make feedback readable somewhere in that dashboard (private api for only admin, so me, id have an entire section just for my acc, accessible from a link and nothing else)
- status.lumen.onl with some live status like google or idk
- --- cli --- lum ollama folder/file (default root) (for later not in objectives / not a priority basically)
- --- cli --- lum config --edit model ollama


socials :
- linkedin for lumen, + ceo on mine + dox myself before launch
- show that we had 5k downloads on our cli tool, stars on GitHub (62 for now), generated thousands of views through reddit posts (10k +), thousand through twitter (5k+) and linkedin soon ?
- argument for lumen: the dataset evolves and is continuously growing, it has an ai summary, could search by keywords... etc we are legal free, like legally we make the datasets usable
- can provide strategic datasets that are sold to only one specific company for way higher prices? private datasets
- companies will not only buy raw data, but actually pre-processed data, clean data with no duplicates, no comments, atcual metrics and most importantly scores that can make datasets go from low quality and not worth anything, to high quality in high quantity and worth WAY more than anything
- add whitepaper / roadmap with datasets objectives, for example in a month, 10M tokens collected or idk
- make the discord embed / twt / etc look better, redesign on the image and add texts to it

fund raising / companies / money involved :
- need to validate with ai companies or any group, how much 1B token is worth on each quality level, and what is each quality level in details
NO FUNDING NEEDED FOR THIS - minimum amount before cashout, or lock any cashout for first 30 days to accumulate code and be able to run the business model, one is good and the other might be seen negatively (maybe even a scam?) but that's not the objective, if we can make the token grow for a full month and THNE they can cashout they would earn even more which would be rly nice
IF FUNDING - for initial reward 500 users, then 2k... etc etc, so after contribution, they get a dollar equivalent of like a pourcentage of what we can potentially raise, then we raise again and go to 2k beta users and so on and so on
- transform value on dashboard from $LUM to dollars ? so we get some value, then we go from dollars, convert into lumens and make the transfer process work well basically over that lumen price

FIXES / THINGS TO ADD :
easy :
- make algo give accurate rewards, scale with business model per tokens, give 20% to user, take 80% for ONE sell (meaning we can sell their code MULTIPLE times, unless contract that makes us sell code for higher price but makes it private)
- push to prod on pypi when done before launch
- change reverse proxy to return 404 / error when bots scrape the website (can change robots.txt ?)
- lumen ssr (server side rendering) plugin for vite js, so we get good seo on google and not shit one like it is now, do robots.txt
- make landing page better on mobile, smaller stuff overall and dont feel condensed like it is
- rework landing page part 2 (issue / solution) rly bad design overall, for a first scroll content it feels badly designed and doesnt fit with the website aesthethic overall
- complete default config lumen client

medium :
- allow 3 contributions a day, find a way to not limit these 3 if its failed contributions (like if ai gives 0 or idk)
- fix gitignore not reading well (backend\lib -> removing anything that ends in \lib, for example frontend\lib...)
- move lumen.onl/docs to docs.lumen.onl and this would show docs.lumen.onl/installation for example instead of /docs/installation

hard :
- (after business.lumen.onl dashboard etc) -> make sure if ai gives 0, we still get that in our base (if the code is non secure), because storing code isn't dangerous, its using it that is (and we could get a category on that, "dangerous" where data buyers could also be interested in getting)
- need to make sure when a user updates a project it removes the old to replace with the new ? (and don't allow the opposite to happen, like someone reducing the size of its project, like in the db I mean, find a potential solution)
- (so like if someone contributes an old project, if it was sold to a company for example or taken privately, find a way to give them an update or then change ?? or idk, its complex maybe not do this at all ?)

data part (saas part):
- on business.lumen.onl
- seperate the whole website in 2 parts, pro part and user part, find a way to make ppl that look for business find the business.lumen.onl website easily from the main website, but dont make it intrusive ofc
- signup / login system completely seperate from normal lumen ONLY for data buyers
- they have a dashboard (rly abstract) -> they can generate / revoke api keys from there, have some graphs with stats like users but for token usage on their api key one by one or all api keys ?
- they can see the left tokens they can use
- they have a doc to use the api we will make (so they enter their api key as a header or idk in that, and they would use this api key to then take the data in certain formats)
- physical marketplace for them too, so they can see the code physically ? they can rank by score, quality etc (do a search that is initially empty, that would consume their tokens, cant go below 0 and id give these users the tokens they can use since its a one by one thing)
- from my admin dashboard i can manage saas users, give them tokens etc ? or just give them plans or whatever
- in that search marketplace, theyd have many things, they can use the 3 ai scores we have from 0 to 10, they can look for a range too (from 0 to 5 for example)
- maybe instead of a token system, make more like a price system, each code quality differs and has a price, so 0 is not free but almost worthless... etc etc and they would have a balance that they can topup? 250€ = 250000 of a currency for example to then get the datasets
- signup page for saas with new fields, more pro etc... only one account per company, but can make many api keys that can just be renamed and that have more or less permissions (permissions idea might be useless, need to see if i do it)
- maybe team management, so a user can invite other users to his account but he would be only the admin, only him, so they wouldnt have to share a password for many users etc
- data sandbox / explorer (marketplace) as we talked about, physical one that is limited but free then? or idk, api part would be paid, free data part would always show the same data anyways and wouldnt be worthless but overall make it not take from our data, but show enough data
- remove data hub page from lumen, business.lumen.onl would be seperate frontend (home page for business, signup, login, pricing, dashboard, docs = all pages), but would still use lumens backend
- sorting system for admin + those who buy data, can select only high quality files ? or by score, language etc... (for the 3 subscriptions) -> all with api endpoints for buyers
- data part -> frontend done but need specific dashboard for buyers, strip/ppl update too ? unlock it after a delay? (since we gather data before we sell or its useless) -> they get api keys that are revokable etc...
- potential admin dashboard (for far3000yt@gmail.com / password)
- saas part has its own branding, should be way higher quality than what we've done so far, we attract buyers not ppl that want to gain !! they provide the money they are the reason lumen will be alive
