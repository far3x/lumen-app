AI model, please do not take this file into account unless i specify it.

fund raising / companies / money involved (not care) :
- need to validate with ai companies or any group, how much 1B token is worth on each quality level, and what is each quality level in details

after launch :
- vps upgrade after too much ram usage / contributions (most likely @ 1k users)
- from uvicorn to gunicorn ?

not a priority :
- daily bonuses ?? (we can call this the sniping leaderboard or idk, like 10 tasks daily that users can snipe) this day -> rust += x LUMEN$ automatically if good quality ? + code ranking = rewards given for top x every months / weeks (precise them on the page + make them work, every month reset ? or smth like that)
- make the referral system (no abuse with alt accounts etc... or then forget abt the idea, rly not a priority)
- make feedback readable somewhere in that dashboard (private api for only admin, so me, id have an entire section just for my acc, accessible from a link and nothing else)
- --- cli --- lum ollama folder/file (default root) (for later not in objectives / not a priority basically)
- --- cli --- lum config --edit model ollama


socials :
- argument for lumen: the dataset evolves and is continuously growing, it has an ai summary, could search by keywords... etc we are legal free, like legally we make the datasets usable
- can provide strategic datasets that are sold to only one specific company for way higher prices? private datasets
- companies will not only buy raw data, but actually pre-processed data, clean data with no duplicates, no comments, atcual metrics and most importantly scores that can make datasets go from low quality and not worth anything, to high quality in high quantity and worth WAY more than anything


TO DO SOON :
- admin.lumen.onl -> my dashboard with only my account and password i made and hashed myself with db commands to simplify things -> from there can check : all feedback, all users with search, can do actions on users like restart their balance or idk, dont make it a priority the commands for users if its just sql commands, from there ability to manage contact sales demands too instead of mails ? (ofc they receive an auto mail but id be managing mails from there)
- from my admin dashboard i can manage saas users, give them tokens etc ? or just give them plans or whatever
- potential admin dashboard (for far3000yt@gmail.com / password)
