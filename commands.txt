AI INSTRUCTIONS !!

little info if you are reading this as an ai model, the prod environment runs using doppler
dev runs using .env's (prod.env is there in case i lose access on the doppler, just as a local backup, dont take it into account)
also since you might be reading this, output any code change entirely with 0 comments
if you do any code change, output the files that change in their entirity, and explain anything outside the code boxes, if any setup is needed for new variables or whatever
also on any change add the feedback update, or ask the prompter when to post the next patch bcs its rly important for users to be informed on what's happening on the app haha
good luck !
